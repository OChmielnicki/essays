This juncture essay will be talking about ==George Bellows's=={Q167132} piece "==Love of Winter=={Q20267532}" as part of a series of paintings he did portraying New York under snowfall. This particular piece was inspired by a blizzard that hit New York City in 1914. [^1]

Bellows adds details to his piece to portray the excited energy of New Yorkers on this bright and cheerful wintery day. His  method of slashed brushstrokes gives the piece a sense of movement and nicely captures the moment of the skaters across a lake - some key elements of ==Impressionism=={Q40415}. Contributors on a publication of the piece to the website [Useum](https://useum.org/artwork/Love-of-Winter-George-Bellows) add that the bright and vivid colors are a juxtaposition to the usual "gritty realities of life" that Bellows paints, and that like other Impressionists, put detail into the way the snow appears in the light versus in the shadow. [^2] The hills added to the background might allude to this being located someplace in the mountains, whereas the actual location was still ==Central Park=={Q160409} in New York City.

Two other works I included above were painted as part of Bellows's Impressionist pieces of New York City under snowfall: "==A Morning Snow-Hudson River=={Q70848299}" (left), and "The Palisades" (right). These pieces, along with "Love of Winter", are some of many that capture the transformation of New York City under snowfall. These are also more examples of Bellows's usage of dramatic, vivid brushstrokes that are a key part of Impressionist artwork and make the viewer aware of the movement of the scenes. "A Morning Snow-Hudson River", painted in 1910, depicts the contrast between the stillness of a crisp winter morning and the bustle of the cityfolk going about their day. [^3] "The Palisades", painted in 1909, gives another view of the Hudson River from above. Bellow's usage of complementary colors such as blue and orange give the piece a sense of harmony. [^4]

#Additional Information about the Author

George Bellows was a well-known American realist painter of the late 19th century to early 20th century. His success throughout his artistic career was widely admired, and was deemed as "the most acclaimed American artist of his generation", according to the ==Columbus Museum of Art=={Q5935366}. He was most well-known for his paintings of life in New York City, and I find that his series of works of New York under snowfall connects well with his impressionistic painting motif at that time. In addition to contributing to a wider variety of themes regarding New York City, the wintery landscapes were able to help Bellows in developing his own artistic skills. An article by the [Norton Museum of Art](https://tfaoi.org/newsmu/nmus18e.htm) details how his "New York under snowfall" series helped him master both color composition and paint application for his paintings, further developing his skills as an exceptional artist of the 20th century.
