This juncture essay will be talking about George Bellows's piece "Love of Winter" as part of a series of paintings he did portraying New York under snowfall. This particular piece was inspired by a blizzard that hit New York City in 1914.

Bellows adds details to his piece to portray the excited energy of New Yorkers on this bright and cheerful wintery day. His impressionist method of slashed brushstrokes gives the piece a sense of movement and nicely captures the moment of the skaters across a lake.

Two other works I included above were painted as part of Bellows's Impressionist pieces of New York City under snowfall: "A Morning Snow-Hudson River" (left), and "The Pallisades" (right). These pieces, along with "Love of Winter", are some of many that capture the transformation of New York City under snowfall. These are also more examples of Bellows's usage of dramatic, vivid brushstrokes that are a key part of Impressionist artwork and make the viewer aware of the movement of the scenes. "A Morning Snow-Hudson River", painted in 1910, depicts the contrast between the stillness of a crisp winter morning and the bustle of the cityfolk going about their day. "The Palisades", painted in 1909, gives another view of the Hudson River from above. Bellow's usage of complementary colors such as blue and orange give the piece a sense of harmony.
